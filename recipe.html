<P id="para">A recipe is a set of instructions that 
  describes how to prepare or make something, 
  especially a dish of prepared food.
  The term recipe is also used in medicine or
  in information technology (e.g., user
  acceptance). A doctor will usually begin 
  a prescription with recipe, Latin for take, 
  usually abbreviated as Rx or
  the equivalent symbol (â„ž).</P>
